        <h2> Autobiography </h2>
        <p>
          Joella or Joey is a BS Computer Science student in UPLB, currently in her second year. As someone who dabbles with many things and is yet to figure out themselves, it is sometimes difficult to encapsulate Joeyâ€™s personality. There are a few constants in her life though--the passion for technology, good education, and love. Their goal in life is either to be a very rich philanthropist or a UP professor. She loves animals, breakfast food, art, chill games, her friends and family, and stupid humor.
