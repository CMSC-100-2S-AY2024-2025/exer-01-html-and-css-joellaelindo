                    3. Click save and see deployments to get link.
                    * Made sure to fix file names.

TAKEAWAYS:          I really enjoy whenever I get to do front-end because I get to play around with the creatives aspect of it. Though I also enjoy how logic-heavy back-end tasks are, I think the artist in me still craves that freedom to add color and flair to my craft. I do think I can improve on my time management though, for if I had organized it better, I could've had more fun exploring the different features that HTML and CSS has to provide. Safe to say, I will be doing that in my free time.
